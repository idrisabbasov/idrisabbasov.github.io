## About

I am Professor and Doctor of Philological Sciences and currently serve as Head of the Department of Theoretical Linguistics at the Institute of Linguistics of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences.

My research lies at the intersection of general and theoretical linguistics, with a strong focus on comparative, historical, and cognitive approaches. I work extensively on the grammatical, semantic, and rhetorical structures of languages from both Indo-European and Semitic families.

A central part of my research involves comparative and contrastive studies of Azerbaijani, Turkish, Russian, French, and Arabic, as well as the history and development of the Azerbaijani language. I am also interested in discourse analysis and rhetoric as frameworks for understanding meaning construction in linguistic and cultural contexts.
